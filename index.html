        <p>Hi my name is Zach, and I do the coding for this website! If your reading this, it means you are interested in what this website has to offer, and you wish to know more! Well, this website is an assignment for our school's Coding class. of course, being an assignment, we have to make it as good as we possibly can! So, as stated previously, I'm the one coding! I also handle the older videogame reviews. Dylan is the artist and our anime review provider. Finally, Ethan does nothing. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
