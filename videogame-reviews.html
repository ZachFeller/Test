      <h8>3</h8> <p>darksouls franchise- Dark Souls is insanely difficult, but that doesn't stop the game from being fair. We believe that Dark Souls is a fantastic game. That doesn't mean the game is without its flaws. The game never tells you what to do or where to go, which may make it less accessible to casual gamers. With that said though, Dark Souls still remains one of are top picks. #gitgud

      <h10>1<h10> <p>guilty gear- this game is a 2d anime fighter that is fairly simple to play and very smooth movements and the story is a 4 hour long movie</p>
