      <h1>Contagion Movie review by Zach Feller ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)>⌐■-■ (⌐▀͡ ̯ʖ▀) </h1>
      <p>Contagion is a movie starring Matt Damon about the spread of a single, new disease. This movie focuses on the aspects of human nature, greed, and our ability to survive. However, does this 2011 film hold up today?
	First off, the acting in this movie is top-notch. Every character played is realistic, so it gives the movie a sense of realism. Which brings me to my next point, this movie sets realistic expectations during a time of crisis for all of human kind. From the head of the CDC (Laurence Fishburne), to the CDC field worker (Kate Winslet), contagion has overall terrific acting. 
	Second, the movie has an amazing sense of suspense. Every moment of this movie has you on the edge of your seat, awaiting the next revelation of this human, endangering virus. You fear for the safety of Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) and his daughter, the CDC, who are working closely with the virus, and the WHO worker (Marion Cotillard) in China, who’s gaining Intel on the disease. 
	Sadly, this movie, like all, is not without its faults. Ultimately, the story of Mitch Emhoff and his family goes nowhere. I felt like they were added to the movie simply to give the disease some semblance of origin. Same can be said about the WHO worker. Her research didn’t seem to matter in the long run, as she was never able to leave China, they sort of held her against her will.
	With all that said, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I would give it a solid 8.2/10 for its amazing sense of morals, corruption, greed, and sense of realism and paranoia.</p>
